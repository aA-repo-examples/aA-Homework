Homework

**Let's create a simple Rails project and try out what we've learned so far!**

In this project we'll be creating a simple Rails project to model the relationships between people and houses. By the end of this project, each `Person` will live in a house and each `House` will have an `address`. You will be able to call `House.residents` and get a list of the `people` that live in that `House`. You will also be able to call `Person.house` and get the `House` that that `Person` lives in.
